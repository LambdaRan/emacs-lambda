;;; Commentary:

;; Configure to improve performance
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put init-performance.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'init-performance)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET init-performance RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2019/02/23
;;      * First released.
